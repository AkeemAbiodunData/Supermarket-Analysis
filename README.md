# Supermarket Analysis With Microsoft Excel

## Project Overview

This project analyzes supermarket sales data to extract meaningful insights into customer purchasing patterns, sales trends, and product performance. The analysis was conducted using Excel, leveraging its powerful data processing and visualization capabilities to deliver comprehensive insights.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains detailed sales transactions from a supermarket, including information on:

Product details (category, sub-category, and name)

Sales and profit data

Customer demographics

Transaction details (date, location, and sales amount)

Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, correcting inconsistent data formats, and ensuring accuracy for analysis. The data was then organized to facilitate in-depth exploration and visualization.

## Analysis Techniques

The analysis process involved the following steps:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Removed duplicate entries and handled missing data.

Standardized date formats and numerical values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Examined data distribution and identified outliers.

Performed summary statistics to understand central tendencies and variability.

## Sales Performance Analysis:

Calculated total revenue, profit, and average transaction value.

Analyzed sales trends over time (daily, monthly, and yearly analysis).

Identified top-performing product categories and sub-categories.

## Customer Analysis:

Segmented customers based on purchasing behavior.

Analyzed customer demographics to identify high-value segments.

Visualization and Dashboard Creation:

Created visual representations of sales trends, product performance, and customer segmentation.

Compiled interactive Excel dashboards for easy data exploration.

## Key Insights
